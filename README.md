# BLUESS_BLE
Code for BLUESS project

Code for COMBAT project: 

Energy-aware task scheduler part (work with EE, and e-peas setup, but in this case only for energy-unaware solution)

1. energy_aware -> energy-aware task scheduler implementation with 4 main tasks (temp, store, compute and transmit)
2. energy_aware_led -> energy-aware task scheduler implementation with an extra LED task (added GPIOTE features)
4. light_switch_simple_msg_adnan -> battery/USB powered receiver/server node 

Energy-aware task scheduler part (work with e-peas setup)

1. epeas_setup -> energy-aware task scheduler implementation with all 5 tasks (temp, store, compute, transmit and LED), and capacitor voltage read function implemented 
2. light_switch_simple_msg_adnan -> battery/USB powered receiver/server node
